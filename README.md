# foss4gbe

This repository contains the code for our website: https://foss4g.be .

Different branches exist for every year that we organised.
For past editions, all uploaded content has been added to the repo using [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

To run this site on your own computer you need php and for most years mysql. You can use the deploy scripts [ansible](https://github.com/OSGeo-be/website_deploy) for a full deploy or to get inspiration.
