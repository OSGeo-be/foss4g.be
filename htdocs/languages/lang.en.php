FOSS4G Belgium is the yearly Belgium event about Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial.

It is organised by the Belgium Chapter of the Open Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo.be), which
 is one of the more than 50 local chapters of the Open Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) worldwide.
As of today, almost every week there is a FOSS4G conference, somewhere on this planet. But only one is located in Brussels. <br/><br/>

The conference is for and by everybody who is interested in an open and inclusive world. We promote free and open source software, but also open standards, open data, open government, ...<br/><br/>

During the past conferences, around 400 enthusiasts came over. Thanks to our <a href="sponsors.php">sponsors</a>, we can keep the entrance free.
Volunteers are presenting and sharing their best practices and experiences. Anybody is encouraged to <a href="papers.php">submit a paper to present</a>.
And because the topic is all about Geo, maps are an important topic so we have a wall with the most beautiful maps. 
<a href="maps.php">Show of your best by sending in your maps!</a>. <br /><br />


If we have to describe a FOSS4G conference in one sentence, we should describe the fantastic atmosphere and energy around the event.

Furthermore, in order to get a fresh map each year, we prefer maps that have been created last year.


<p>If you have created maps that you are proud of, please send them over! Together, we create this yearly highlight! Your map can be the result of a commercial venture, created for your community or a personal challenge,... </p>

<h4>Printed maps</h4>

A map intended for printing can be sent in digitally (and we\'ll print them for you) or you can bring it during the conference. In both cases, we ask you to email us beforehand in order to reserve space.

<ul>
<li>Mail us via <a href="mailto:map@foss4g.be&subject=Map submission"/>map@foss4g.be</a> before 8 october.
<li>There\'ll be enough space provided for an A1-sized map.</li>
<li>If you send your map digitally, include it in pdf format with a minimum resolution of 2342 x 3311 pixels. Fonts should be included.</li>
<li>If you bring your own map, please send a small photo or screenshot so that we know what to expect. We might group maps thematically.</li>
<li>Provide a title, author and/or organization, date and description of the map.</li>
<li>Mention what software and data were used to create the map</li>
</ul>


<h4>Interactive maps</h4>

If you created a fancy web map, we\'ll showcase it too! For this, a computer will be placed next to the map wall. If you want to provide an interactive map, then:


<ul>
<li>Mail us via <a href="mailto:map@foss4g.be&subject=Map subimssion"/>map@foss4g.be</a> before 8 october.
